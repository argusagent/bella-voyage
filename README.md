# Bella's Graduation Voyage

Seven nights, three cities — Paris, Beaune & Lausanne, June 3 – 11, 2026.

Live: https://bella-voyage.vercel.app
Deployment runbook: [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)

| Route   | What it is                                                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`     | The main site — Hero + four-tab nav: **Trip · Lodging · Flights · Itinerary**.  This is the QR-code target. |
| `/qr`   | Printable QR-code card.  Server-renders the QR for `/` inline + offers SVG/PNG download + Print. |

---

## Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router) + **TypeScript strict**
- **Tailwind CSS** — palette + typography wired through `tailwind.config.ts`
- **next/font** — Cormorant Garamond (serif), Manrope (sans), JetBrains Mono (mono)
- **Framer Motion** — restrained: hero reveals, scroll-fades, route transitions
- **Embla Carousel** — mobile photo galleries (grid on desktop)
- **qrcode** — server-rendered QR code on `/qr`; static SVG/PNG copies in `public/`
- **Vercel** — auto-deploys every push to `master`

## Editing trip content

**All trip content lives in [`lib/trip-data.ts`](./lib/trip-data.ts).** Editing
this file is how the site changes — components don't need touching.

The home page renders four sections, in order:

| Section       | Drives from                            | Notes                                                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trip          | `trip`, `flights`, `stays`, `timeline` | The landing tab.  Stats grid (days/nights/cities/flights) + route ribbon (Air → Rail → Rail → Air) + city quick-summary that deep-links to Lodging rows. |
| Lodging       | `stays`                                | One expanded card per hotel — Embla on mobile, grid on desktop, gradient placeholders if no images |
| Flights       | `flights`                              | Boarding-pass cards, mobile-stacks vertically                                    |
| Itinerary     | `timeline` + `restaurants` + `activities` + `wineTours` | Each day expandable; restaurants/activities/wine tours fold in **by date** as Tables / Sights / Vineyards subgroups |

Sections render conditionally — empty arrays mean nothing shows up, and
the TabNav drops the corresponding tab too. The Countdown pill in the
sticky tab bar derives its label from `trip.startDate` / `trip.endDate`.

### Add a restaurant reservation (1-minute edit)

```ts
// lib/trip-data.ts
export const restaurants: Restaurant[] = [
  {
    id: "septime-jun-5",
    city: "paris",
    name: "Septime",
    date: "2026-06-05",   // ← join key with the Itinerary day
    time: "20:00",
    partySize: 2,
    reservationCode: "AB12CD",
    url: "https://septime-charonne.fr",
    notes: "Tasting menu only.  Cash gratuity preferred.",
  },
];
```

`git push` → Vercel deploys → it's live in ~60s, and the new card appears
under "Tables" inside the Jun 5 expansion of the Itinerary tab.

### Add a wine tour

```ts
export const wineTours: WineTour[] = [
  {
    id: "drouhin-jun-8",
    city: "beaune",
    date: "2026-06-08",
    time: "10:30",
    domain: "Maison Joseph Drouhin",
    description: "Historic cellars under the old town, eight-vintage tasting.",
    meetingPoint: "7 Rue d'Enfer, Beaune",
    bookingCode: "MJD-2026-06-08",
    url: "https://drouhin.com",
  },
];
```

### Add photos to a stay

```ts
// Drop the file in public/images/paris/   (or beaune/, lausanne/)
// Then reference it:
images: [
  { src: "/images/paris/lobby.jpg", alt: "Marble lobby", width: 1600, height: 1067 },
  ...
]
```

When `images` is empty, the card renders a city-tinted gradient
placeholder so the page never feels broken.

## Local dev

```
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run build        # production build
```

## Visual rules (don't drift)

- Background palette stays light. `#f5efe2` paper, `#ebe2cf` warm,
  `#f9f4e8` bone for section breaks. The Landing's vineyard background
  is the only intentional moment of darker tone — and it sits behind a
  paper wash so text always reads.
- Cormorant Garamond ONLY for hero h1, section titles, stay/city names.
  Manrope for body, buttons, nav, descriptions. JetBrains Mono only for
  metadata (dates, codes, flight numbers).
- Every section header: gold rule + mono section number → Cormorant
  title with italic accent → Manrope subtitle at ~70% ink opacity.
- Animations stay restrained: hero line reveals, fade-ups on scroll,
  smooth tab transitions. No hover bounces, no extra parallax.

## Interactivity guarantees

- Tap targets ≥ 44px on mobile.
- Focus-visible outlines via the global `:focus-visible` rule.
- ARIA on tabs, expandable rows, the live countdown.
- Touch carousels use `touch-pan-y` so vertical scroll passes through.
- All animations honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Countdown

The pill in the trip-page tab bar (and the big number on the Landing)
both come from `lib/countdown.ts`, which derives one of three states
from `new Date()`:

| Phase    | Trigger                       | Pill copy           |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `before` | today < `trip.startDate`      | `35 days away`      |
| `live`   | start ≤ today ≤ end           | `Day 4 of 9`        |
| `after`  | today > `trip.endDate`        | `home`              |

## QR code

The QR code that opens the live site is **already generated** and lives at
`public/bella-voyage-qr.{svg,png}`.  Visit `/qr` on the deployed site for
a printable card (server-renders the same QR inline, with download +
print buttons).

If the production URL ever changes, regenerate:

```
npm run gen:qr
```

This re-writes both files from `https://bella-voyage.vercel.app/` (set
in `scripts/generate-qr.mjs`) using high error-correction and the site
palette so the asset reads as part of the brand.

State recomputes every 60 minutes so a session left open over midnight
rolls forward correctly.
